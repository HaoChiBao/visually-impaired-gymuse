# Visually Impaired Gym Use

Sure, here is a summary of how this app uses Google Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text to assist visually impaired gym users with exercise information:

The "Visually Impaired Gym Use" app leverages the power of Google Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text technologies to provide a seamless experience for visually impaired individuals at the gym.

Using the app, visually impaired users can access detailed information about different exercises by simply speaking their queries. The app utilizes the Speech-to-Text feature to convert the user's spoken words into text, which is then processed to identify the exercise-related query.

Once the query is identified, the app uses the Google Text-to-Speech feature to convert the exercise information into spoken words. This allows visually impaired users to receive real-time audio feedback about the exercise, including instructions, technique tips, and safety precautions.

The app also offers a user-friendly interface that allows visually impaired users to navigate through different exercises and access relevant information with ease. The combination of Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech technologies makes the app an invaluable tool for visually impaired individuals looking to stay active and healthy at the gym.
